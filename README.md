## Further help

Application is structured in modules for users, posts and comments. All api calls are made using a service, to initialize data, then it worked locally to maintain the state of the elements when they are updated/removed.

## Wireframes design

There was some changes in the initial wireframe proposal, mainly to have a cleaner UI, for example in the Post View I removed the column with all latest comments because it was a little confusing for the user to have it there.
